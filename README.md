# MineSweeper
Mine sweeper is my first Pygame project ever, which I primarily made to learn the basics of Pygame, and also, just because I felt like making MineSweeper!

# Installation
What you need to play this is "Pygame". You can download and install Pygame from here:

https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Besides this, you need to have "Python3" installed.
